# distributed-system-design
## goal
To practice a structured approach to solving system design problems, as such:
1. use a step-by-step process to guide the flow
2. use a timer to record total duration, factored into final output for grading
3. use a templated approach, ie prompting for workflows and components, prompting for considerations, options, and trade-offs
4. based on workflows and components, generate a mermaid diagram (exportable to excalidraw)
5. generate a final MD file in the end, for pasting into an external LLM for grading
