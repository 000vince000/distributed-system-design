Do a detailed design of airbnb. 
focus on search. not booking. 
Imagine that we're starting a company together. You're the founding engineer and I'm a technical product manager. My role is to come up with all the product requirements so you can ask me any questions or clarifications regarding what we'd like to build.

Together, we're going to build the first version of something very similar to Airbnb.

For the focus of this interview, I'd like us to focus on the search functionality, which is the ability for users to search for a list of properties.

For the first version, I'd like to include the basic filters:

- Location: We can get to the details of what this looks like soon since this can be implemented many ways
- Check-in, check-out date
- Amenities: E.g. has wifi, has hottub, is pet friendly

The results of the filter is there should be a list on the left sidebar with a map on the right, displaying listings that match the filters from the search

For this interview, I'd like to see

1. what data-models you'd create
2. The API and its behavior
3. How we'd design everything needed to support users filling out the search page to seeing the results
